# Assignment for Software Engineer @ Platy.Studio

## Objective
Convert input.ass into output.ass using Python/Perl/Shell code. ASS, or Advanced Substation Alpha, is a subtitle format that supports text formatting and positioning. For the purpose of this assignment, you can ignore the functionalities offered by ASS and just focus on transforming the 'Events' section in the 'input.ass' file. 'input.ass' is a time synced subtitle, which mentions the start and end time for each word as a seperate 'event'. The goal of this assignment is to add the previous line and next line along with the current time, to use the 'output.ass' subtitle file for karaoke purposes. In case there is no previous line or next line, '...'(three dots) can be added. Please see input_video.mp4 (made using input.ass) and output_video.mp4 (made using output.ass), just for reference and easy visualization.
